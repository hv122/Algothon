# Algothon

Our solution for a Algorithmic Trading problem provided by BlackRock at IC Algothon '23, based around Sortino ratios.
In this Algothon we learnt a lot more about algorithmic trading, common metrics used to judge risk and returns, as well
as various Python libraries we hadn't used in so much detail in the past.
